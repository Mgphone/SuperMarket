"In promises, you use the resolve and reject functions inside
 the promise executor function to signal success or failure of 
 the asynchronous operation, respectively. Then, you employ the 
 .then() and .catch() methods to handle the outcome of the promise:
  .then() for successful fulfillment and .catch() for rejection."use 
  .then and catch to make sure for callback
