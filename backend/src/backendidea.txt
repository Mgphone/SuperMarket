commit 4 master Mongo
i think i will need 4 schemas for this backend
1.User 2.Branches 3.Rate 4.Transition
User----Model username,password,branch,role
Branches---Model i make as array with branches
Rate--same like branch i will make with array
transition..array save

mongo can use select(password:1)
Users.findOne({username}).select({password:0})

"In promises, you use the resolve and reject functions inside
 the promise executor function to signal success or failure of 
 the asynchronous operation, respectively. Then, you employ the 
 .then() and .catch() methods to handle the outcome of the promise:
  .then() for successful fulfillment and .catch() for rejection."use 
  .then and catch to make sure for callback

res.status(200).json(rate);vs      res.status(200).json({rate}); that is totally difference
for the ACID transitions
so for the transations i have to make 
firstly using session with 
1.mongoose.startSession()
 after that make it 
 2.startTransition.. 
 3.using try catch blog
  inside the try and catch finish data save use 
  4.
  a)committranctions and 
  b)end it... 
  for the catch blog make it 
  5.
  a)abort and 
  b)endsession
 const session = await mongoose.startSession();
          session.startTransaction();
          try {
            await session.commitTransaction()
              session.endSession()
          } catch (error) {
            await session.abortTransaction();
            session.endSession;
            res.status(403).json({ message: "Error Happen in the transition" });
          }
for mongodb.. coneection for types
I can say when i want to get query for ObjectId("hexcodeof mongo") 
i have to use "new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(my mongo id)"
 because that is for type save and important for collection connections
 if i use mongodb driver can make {ObjectId} from mongodb
 then easiy use new ObjectId(my id)

 pagination:
 backend...
 mongodb 
 i add pagination with sort -1 that mean big to small
 i add pagelimit with params and get the number
 make two value one for pagination and another for full to send to front
 front end..
 for the api call i add ?pagelimit ...
 for extra i add usestate and extra 5 every time
